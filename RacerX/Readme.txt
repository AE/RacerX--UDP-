Qt SDK Installation
===============================================

The easiest way to compile and run the code is to install Qt SDK from 

http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-linux-x11-32bit-cpp

for 32 bit linux and 

http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/sdk-linux-x11-64bit-cpp

for 64 bit linux.

Once installed it is possible to build and run the code using Qt creator.


Instructions on running the RacerX client
===============================================

So far, all that is required is to simply run the RacerX binary. This might change in future.
